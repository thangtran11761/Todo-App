# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

làm todo app
header
1 cái checkbox  với input nhập nội dung
checkbox - true - nhiệm vụ hoàn thành
checkbox - false - nhiệm vụ chưa hoàn thành
enter để thêm nhiệm vụ

mỗi nv đc thêm sẽ hiển thị bên dưới
phần hoàn thành và chưa hoàn thành đc chia làm 2 vùng
trong 1 nv có checkbox ( trạng thái nv ) nội dung và xóa
kích đúp vào nv để sửa nộid ung enter để lưu

với checkbox trạng thái, có thể thay đổi sau khi add , kích vào true thì đưa đến container hoàn thành
false thì đưa đến container chưa hoàn thành

dùng 
typescript
reactjs
redux
fetch / axios

2 cái đầu thôi, còn lại là do thêm vào

tình trạng, ko POST đc, ko bắt đc sự kiện enter để thêm nhiệm vụ - t dùng onKeyUp ( e.keyCode === '13' )
